"August 03, 2021",Remarks on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic and an Exchange with Reporters,"
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Last week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 vi- -- pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.
This is a very different variant than what we've dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases. It accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today. Experts tell us that we're going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead -- a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.
What's different about this surge from previous ones is we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down
our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw what happened last year.
And while cases are on the rise, it's important to note we've not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
That's because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans -- our seniors.
The best line of defense against the Delta vac- -- the virus is the vaccine. It's as simple as that. Period. The vaccine.
I want to be crystal clear about what's happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Now, I know there's a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you're vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19. And even if you do, the chances are you won't show any symptoms; and if you do, they'll most likely be very mild.
Vaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19. In fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated.
And the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among -- have been among the unvaccinated people. Ninety-nine percent.
That means, if you're unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.
This is a tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. The data is absolutely clear: As I've said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Think of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18. A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven't gotten their first shot.
You know, I think there's a clear link between the lowest-vaccinated -- I know -- I don't think, actually -- the lowest-vaccinated states and the states with the highest case rates.
This past week, the most vaccinated state in America,
Vermont, has seen just five new cases -- five -- per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that state. That means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire state of Vermont got COVID-19.
Nearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.
But the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people. It's moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community. And it's heartbreaking, particularly because it's preventable.
That's why we're doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated. And we're seeing real results.
In the past two weeks, we have seen a 55 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day.
In the last seven days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot. That's the highest seven-day total in a month.
Importantly, over the past two weeks, the eight states with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day. The message is getting through, apparently.
Louisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that state per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day.
Arkansas is up 99 percent. Mississippi is up 125 percent. Alabama is up 186 percent -- going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day. This will make a big difference.
These are encouraging signs. We have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated.
Last week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on states to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot.
You know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that. And North Carolina announced its 100-day incentive -- its $100 incentive today.
Places that have offered the hundred thou- -- the hundred thousand -- (laughs) -- the hundred dollars -- that'd be really good. I'd go back and get vaccinated three times. (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.
We also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.
And I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong. All federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements. Any federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
I directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
And I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops because others are required.
I approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.
And the good news is that now many are following the federal government's lead. In the past several days, states and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.
And the private sector is stepping up as well. Even Fox has vaccination requirements. I want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees.
Look, I know this isn't easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.
But others have declined to step up. I find it disappointing. And worst of all, some state officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.
As of now, seven states not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated. Some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.
And the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say state universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.
What are we doing?
COVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together -- we have to come together -- all of us together, as a country, to solve it.
Make no mistake: The les- -- the exc- -- ex- -- excuse me -- the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates. Just two states, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Just two states.
Look, we need leadership from everyone. And if some governors aren't willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it.
I say to these governors, ""Please, help."" But if you aren't going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.
I've made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected. That was my priority. And let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.
At the same time, it's also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today.
From the beginning of my presidency, I've been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it's in America's self-interest to do so.
The virus knows no boundaries. You can't build a wall high enough to keep it out. There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other -- from the COVID-19 in other countries.
In fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad. As long as the virus continue to rage outs- -- rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.
And we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments. And as we've seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people.
So just as the American economy is recovering, it's in all of our interests to have global -- the global economy begin to recover as well.
This is about our values. We value inherent dignity of all people -- the inherent dignity of everyone. In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand. That's who we are.
And I've said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.
And we're backing up that commitment. We have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX -- the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.
We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia –- known as ""the Quad.""
During my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them -- those doses -- nearly -- to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don't have the vaccine. Those doses will start to ship at the end of this month.
We also announced that we'd donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.
And today, I have an important update. We've already exceeded 80 million doses that have been -- gone out. As of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S. vaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world.
Let me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.
According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia -- all those nations combined.
These vaccine donations from America are free. We're not selling them. There are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached. And there is no favoritism and no strings attached. We're doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic. That's it.
In fact, we're donating vaccines to countries that have real issues -- we have real issues with.
And we'll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S. manufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.
And it's not just vaccines. We are continuing to provide
countries with -- in need -- with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus. We've done it in India and elsewhere.
Let me close with this. I've said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.
And the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again -- in two ways. First, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home. And second, to show we can help address it around the world.
Vaccinate America and help vaccinate the world -- that's how we're about to beat this thing.
We're always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one. Our work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we'll deliver.
It's showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our government can all work together.
Above all, it's proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world -- not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
We still have a lot of work to do. So if you're unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.
But just don't take it from me. Just read the news. Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital. They are spending [sending] the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world -- a powerful message to everybody. As they're lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" The doctors have to look them in the eye and say, ""No, sorry. It's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated. If I just…""
Folks, this is isn't about politics. The virus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. This is about life and death. Life and death.
I can't say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child's.
You know, I know we can do this. We're the United States of America. We're prepared like never before. We have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.
This is who we are. This is what we do. This is why there's no nation like us on Earth.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
And I'll take a few questions.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I'd like to start with the news of the day -- given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign. So, will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?
THE PRESIDENT: I stand by that statement.
Q: Are you now calling on him to resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q: And if he doesn't resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?
THE PRESIDENT: Let's take one thing at a time here. I think he should resign.
Q: Do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact; I've not read all that data.
Q: And he's using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him. Do you condone that?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I'm not going to flyspeck this. I'm sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but app- -- apparently, the Attorney General decided there were things that weren't.
Q: And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.
THE PRESIDENT: Why don't you come up and take the platform? (Laughter.)
Q: No, thank you.
On the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering -- a targeted moratorium -- is likely to face legal challenges?
THE PRESIDENT: Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles. I've indicated to the CDC I'd like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in pow- -- in existence, which the Court has declared they're not going to allow to continue. And the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to two hours.
Q: Thank you.
Q: President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?
THE PRESIDENT: I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so na- -- poor nations that need help should do so. We had that discussion at the G7. A number of those countries said they were going to do that. Some have followed through.
The point I was making is, though, I've kept the commitment -- we've kept the commitment that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.
Q: Mr. President, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?
THE PRESIDENT: I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents. And it's clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy -- bad health policy.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question about something that you just said.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sure you do.
Q: Thank you. You just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus. So what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S. cities in record numbers?
THE PRESIDENT: There is -- what we're doing -- we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical -- criticized -- saying that unvaccinated people should be -- go back across the border.
But unaccompanied children is a different story, because there's -- that's the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.
Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?
THE PRESIDENT: I have not.
Q: And then one other question on the virus. You just said we have -- we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. Other countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places. New York City just announced today that they'll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms. Do you think more cities and states should institute rules like that?
THE PRESIDENT: I do.
Q: And are you going to publicly call on them? Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it's up to each city and state to figure that out on their own?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. What did you say?
Q: Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think they need to do that. I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, ""In order to come in, you have to give proof that you've been vaccinated or you can't come in.""
I'll take a couple more.
Q: Mr. President can I ask you about news of the day -- one more on Governor Cuomo? You're calling for him to resign now. My question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted? And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the Attorney General concluded that the allegations were correct, that -- back in March -- that I would recommend he resign. That's what I'm doing today. I've not read the report. I don't know the detail of it. All I know is the end result.
Q: Mr. President, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly. It's the eviction moratorium. Can you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place? There was -- there are people -- this expired on Saturday. I'm wondering -- there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the courts made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn't stand. And they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15th or July 18th.
In the meantime, what I've been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to states to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can't afford to stay in their homes because they can't -- an apartment -- they can't pay their rent. And so, we're urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords. I believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their -- in their ho- -- in their apartments now.
And so that's what we're working on. Some states have done it and some communities have, but they have not. The money is there. It's not -- we don't have to send it out. It's been sent out to the states and counties -- billions of dollars -- for the express purpose of providing for back rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis. And that's there; that's what we're pushing now. And we've been pushing that. That's the immediate thing to do.
I'll take one more question.
Q: Mr. President, thank you so much. There was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today -- a new -- other than the ones you promised. Are you ready to send more vaccines to the world?
And there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow. Are they bringing more vaccines? Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?
THE PRESIDENT: No -- are they announcing more vaccines overall?
Q: Overall. And then to Brazil -- for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow -- will you be bringing vaccines?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is: I don't know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them. We have provided vaccines to --
Q: Are they bringing the announcement? Are they announcing there?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, there's a need for several billion doses around the world. We have committed to over a half a billion doses. And we're trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we're helping them do that. That's what we're doing now.
And we're trying to -- we're -- and, by the way, it's free. We're not charging anybody anything. And we're trying to do as much as we possibly can.
Thank you all very much.
Q: Mr. President, we're learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related. Can you tell us any more about that? And are you sure it's going to pass Supreme Court muster?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is twofold. One, I've sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC's judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.
The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster. Number one. But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it's worth the effort. But the present -- you could not -- the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.
So I think what you're going to see, and I -- look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do. So I don't want to get ahead.
The CDC has to make the -- I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them. You're going to hear from them what those other options are.
I have been informed they're about to make a judgment as to potential other options. Whether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can't tell you. I don't know. There are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it's not likely to.
But, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we're getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don't have the money. That's why it was passed in -- in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the states.
We were under the impression that the states were moving this money out relatively rapidly. So, for example, if I'm in an apartment -- if you're in an apartment, and you're behind on four- or five-month's rent, and let's say your rent is $2,000 a month -- I'm just making this up out of the blue -- and you're behind, you need $10,000 to catch up. Hardly anybody has that $10,000. But there is money that the states have that can give to the landlord that $10,000 to the back rent.
The future rent, it's unlikely -- at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point -- that they'd be inclined -- because the economy is growing -- inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person -- no guarantee -- keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that -- that person to be able -- who may now be employed -- to pay their rent.
But in the meantime, I've asked, isn't there any safety valve we can put in? And it's the one I explained to you. Again, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works. I'm not telling -- I told them I want them to take a look. I didn't tell them what they had to do.
And my hope is, it's going to be a new moratorium that in some way -- and I'm not going to announce it now; I'll let them announce it -- in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters. And so that's all I can tell you now.
Thank you very much.
Q: Why not 100 percent? What's the difference?
THE PRESIDENT: Because it's a -- (laughs) -- let them explain that to you. Okay? I don't want to get too far ahead.
Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?
Q: Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) To say ""happy birthday""? What? I mean --
Q: To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about ""get out of the way.""
THE PRESIDENT: He knows the message. He knows the message. We had a little discussion when I was down there. He knows the message.
Q: What did he say to you in that discussion?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) See you all later.

"August 03, 2021",Remarks in a Meeting with Latino Community Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters,"
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today, I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under- -- that's undergoing -- we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot.
The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissionable [sic] -- transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we're not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it's critical to keeping the economy strong.
And in six months, we're seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration, and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.
And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in.
I've been saying from the beginning when I announced that I'm tired of trickle down. It doesn't work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That's what this is all about.
And so, creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and -- including Latino neighborhoods -- delivering affordable child and -- care and paid leave and universal pre-K, two years of community college.
You know, today marks, as we all know -- no one knows this better than this community – a two-year -- two years of -- since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.
But you know, I did a piece -- Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn't talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of post-traumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I -- and the need for -- and I hope we'll -- we can talk about it a little bit later as well -- is the need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they've survived.
But to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love -- as all of you do, I know.
But I know, you know, these anniversaries are -- should be celebrated in a sense of recognize -- so we see things don't happen again. But, you know, they're terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I -- it takes enormous courage for people to -- to respond that way.
You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second.
The El Paso community -- you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal -- and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it -- heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just -- anyway.
The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And, you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so, I continue to do everything in my power to do that.
The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism -- domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy. We're going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.
And my administration is carrying out the country's first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism -- from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence, and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.
And I'm going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we're going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they've been reluctant to do.
That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle -- anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just -- it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to say, ""You can't do that."" But it just has to stop.
And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to -- from reining in ""ghost guns"" and -- to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having -- bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.
And, you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And -- but, with that, we're going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight -- today. And I'm looking forward to it.
So, thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.
Q: Mr. President, should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir? Should Andrew Cuomo resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Q: Should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Wait -- wait a second. Be quiet, please.
I'm going to be speaking on COVID at four o'clock this afternoon, and I'll take questions on COVID and other issues after that.
Thank you.
Q: Thank you, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tom. Thanks for that introduction and for your generous support. And I want to thank you all. And, Jamie, for your support as well and being willing to take on the chairmanship.
You know, I didn't have it like you did, but I remember when my dad -- when things died up in Scranton; the coal dried up. He wasn't a coalminer; my great grandfather was. But he wasn't a coalminer, but everything else dried up. And he said -- I remember him going home to my grandpop, who had four sons and a daughter, and asking him is it okay if his wife -- my mother, Jean -- and the three kids move in with him for a year or so until they got straightened away down in northern Delaware -- a little town called Claymont.
And so that -- and he said -- I'll never forget it. He said, ""I'll come home every weekend, Joey. Every weekend. There's only 147 -- 157 miles."" And I thought, ""My God, that's a million miles."" I was going -- I was in third grade, going into fourth. And you know, it's a --
They used to have an expression -- and that's never -- and this is the God's truth. We got down to Delaware, as he worked his way through, after five years, being able to buy a small three-bedroom home. He used to say, ""Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck. It's about -- it's about your pride. It's about your place in the community. It's about your ability to look your kids in the eye. It's about your dignity."" And so it's much -- so much more.
And so, you know, when I ran with your help -- and I couldn't have made it -- with all the help of people on this line -- you know -- you know, we are part of something special because you allowed me to compete.
We -- I think we put together one of the most consequential campaigns in modern history. Because it really was, in my view, a battle for the soul of the nation: basic decency, building the middle class form the bottom up and the middle out, rather than waiting for everything to trickle down.
And a lot of you are very successful people on the line, but you shared that view and you gave me the money and contributions to be able to complete -- you know, I say -- I should say ""compete.""
And so, we're bound together in one of the most consequential first six months in the history of this country not because of me -- it's about the country; it's about people stepping up.
Think about the last six months. The American Rescue Plan.
We delivered shots in arms of millions and millions of people. Checks in pockets to hundreds of millions of Americans. And maybe the thing that I'm proudest of: We got the biggest middle-class tax cut of all time with the help of the -- cutting the child poverty in half through the childcare -- the Child Tax Credit.
And 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated. You got over 190 that have at least one shot -- one shot.
It's the fastest job growth in the first four months of any previous presidency. Period.
And a projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent -- the highest in four decades.
And last week, they -- the infrastructure plan that I introduced when I was running and put together with a bipartisan group -- I had to make some compromises, but it's going to make a gigantic difference.
For example, it's going to transform the economy. It's over -- over a trillion dollars. It's going to eliminate all lead pipes in America so people have decent drinking water. Build roads up to -- up to snuff so we build them back to, you know, making sure that they are where the environment is now -- not -- we have to build them back better. Childcare. The caring economy. The eldercare. The things that the American public wants most.
Man, look -- and delivering high-speed Internet to every American. Delivering clean water, as I said, to every American.
Building more resilient power grids. Installing electric vehicle charging stations-- over 500,000. The largest investment in public transit in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.
But it's all about, as my dad's notion, it's about creating good-paying American jobs for millions of middle-class people and the working-class people. And it's about our economic competitiveness.
You know, as a -- as the Democratic Party, I think we're going to be able to say, going into these off-year elections, as the chairman said, that we can deliver. We can deliver for the American people. We can bring the country together. We can make a difference in their lives.
And, you know, it's about including everyone this time around -- Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American communities -- because I said the administration and our efforts would reflect what the country looked like.
And as I said, we're in the race for the 21st century economy and the rest of the world is not hanging around and waiting. We have to move fast.
And the bottom line, for me, is this: that we're signaling -- we're signaling to the rest of the world and to ourselves that we can function, we can deliver, we can do significant things. And we've got a lot more to do as we invest in physical infrastructure, also invest in human infrastructure, childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K through two years of -- and two years of community college.
When I hear about, ""Well, you know, that's not -- that's not investing"" -- well, let me tell you, when I was Vice President, I was asked to do a survey along the Secretary of Commerce of the 500 CEOs of the five -- Fortune 500 to see what their greatest needs are. We got the 340-some. You know what they said, almost to a person? They said, ""We need a better-educated public."" Well, they're not educating the public. And so, what are we going to do?
If I said to you tomorrow, ""We can maintain exorbitant tax cuts for the super wealthy"" -- and many of you are -- ""or we can make sure that every kid, starting at age three, four, and five, is in preschool, not daycare, and they have access to community college so we're the best-educated public in the world,"" which do you think is going to best promote the country's growth? You know what it is.
So, look, let me close. I'm -- I'm taking too much time. I want to meet each one of you. But, look, we need -- the single-most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways I haven't seen in my entire career. And I was the guy who was able to get the Voting Rights exten- -- Act extended 25 years before, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And it wasn't until the Supreme Court came along and said, ""No, no, don't need it anymore.""
It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts, and who gets to count that vote. We have a system that does both those things with independence and integrity. But what Republicans want to do is say a political party gets to decide if a vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell so that doesn't happen. That's one of the most important things we can do.
There's a lot of work ahead. It's not going to be easy. But I'm going to need you to do it. The DNC is going to need you. And because -- here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party. As we look to 2022, we need to stay unified. The question the American people are going to be asking is whether we're helping them and their families, and do we understand what they're going through; do we understand their problem; can we deliver for them.
You know, as Democrats, we have to show that we understand, number one; we're delivering, number two; and we're keeping our promise. We just have to keep making our case -- just as the Republican party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog --that the government isn't the problem, and show that we, the people -- we, the people, are always the solution.
We're the most unique country in the history of the world. You've heard me say this before. We're the only country that's organized based on an ide- -- on an idea, not religion, ethnicity, geography -- on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are critical equal, endowed -- you know the rest.
But you have to be able to vote. It's the single-most important thing we could do. And we're going to have to win races up and down the ticket.
You know, in 2018, I was out of office, but I campaigned in 58 districts -- congressional districts they said we couldn't win. We won back the United States Congress.
And, look, if we make the right decision in the next few years, in 50 years people are going to look back and say, ""This was the moment that America won the 21st century."" I really believe that. But we can't do it without you. You know, we have to prove that democracies can work.
I'll conclude by saying -- and the press on the line has heard me say this before -- that Xi Jinping, and -- who I met hours and hours with -- over 25 hours -- 24 hours alone. When I won, he called me to congratulate me. We spent two hours and, I think, almost 25 minutes on the phone.
He believes, along with other autocrats, that in the modern world, things are changing so rapidly, so quickly that democracies can't get their acts together and unite to compete with -- with autocratic governments. He truly believes that. And he's decided that they're going to be the most powerful military force in the world, and the largest economy and the most organized economy in the world by 2045.
We've got to demonstrate that democracies can work and protect. And I think it's going to impact on our influence around the world more than anything.
That's why we have to do some of this stuff together with others to get it done -- get it done. And I'm convinced there's not much we can't do. I think the country is ready. And because of you, I think we're going to be able to get it done.
But I want to thank you all. Thank you for everything you've done. And, you know, we got to prove we can make democracy work again. That's what it's about.
So, God bless you all for what you've done and going -- going to do. And may God protect our troops.

"July 30, 2021",Remarks in a Meeting with Cuban American Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters,"
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored to welcome members of the Cuban American community, and Senator Menendez, Senator [Congressman] Meeks to discuss how the United States is going to continue to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered for decades and decades under a failed communist regime.
Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who -- who have spoken out. Just disappearing. Family members, I'm told, are not able -- have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And -- in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people.
The Cuban Americans are hurting. They're hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable.
So, I want the Cuban Americans to know that we -- all around this table and myself included -- see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island.
The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. We've brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And we're holding the regime accountable.
Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban armed forces and the government -- a government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters.
And, today, we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief -- the chief and deputy chief.
And we're going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out -- that carry out the regime's abuses.
At the same time, we're increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide Internet access to help the Cuban bypass -- the Cuban people bypass the censorship that's being mandatorily imposed.
You always know something is not going well when the -- a country will not allow -- will not allow their people to be engaged in -- be on the Internet and being able to make their case known around the world.
And we're expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents.
And the direct State -- and I've directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within one month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut.
And we're working to increase U.S. staffing at our embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel.
So, we've got a lot to discuss with this group. So, we got -- and mostly, I'm here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue.
The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that -- you know, the American -- the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people.
And so, my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And we're gong to get down to business.
So, thank you all for bothering to come in. I appreciate it.
Q: Will there be more sanctions coming up, Mr. President? Or is that it, today?
THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon?
Q: I said: Will there be more sanctions against Cuba coming up or are you stopping with what you did today?
THE PRESIDENT: We are -- there will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate.
Thank you.

"July 30, 2021",Remarks with the Vice President in a Virtual Meeting with Governors on Wildfires,"
THE PRESIDENT: Jay, you're beginning to convince the American people there is a thing called ""climate crisis."" About time. (Laughs.)
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Indeed.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for being here. I'm going to make a brief statement here and then we'll get to ask the Vice President to say a few words, get to some questions, and we'll get down to business, if that's okay with you all.
You know, one month ago, we convened the first of what will be a regular presidential briefing on wildfire preparedness. And we're joined by many of the governors who -- we were joined by many of the governors who are with us today, as well as experts from across the administration and leaders from the electric utility sector.
I said then that the threat of Western wildfires this year was as severe as it's ever been. And in the past month, we've sadly seen the truth of that being played out.
Since our -- our last meeting, the number of large, uncontained wildfires has nearly doubled to 66 -- 66 of those fires. And the number of firefighters on the job to battle them has tripled. Over 3.4 million acres have already burned.
In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire has destroyed more than 400 structures, including more than 160 homes. In California, the Dixie Fire has grown to over 220,000 acres and our firefighters are working in really rugged and dangerous conditions and terrain.
The number of states are experiencing the impacts of smoke from these fires, degrading their air quality, not just where the fires are burning, but all the states moving east -- not all, but most.
In short, we've got big, complex wildfires burning across multiple areas. And despite the incredible -- and I'm not -- this is not being solicitous -- the incredible bravery and heroism of our firefighters, our resources are already being stretched to keep up. We need more help, particularly when we also factor in the additional nationwide challenges of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and our ongoing efforts to fight COVID.
We've had a few COVID clusters at our fire camps, which further limits resources. It's just one more reason why it's so darn important that everyone get vaccinated, I might add.
Sadly, we've also lost two brave firefighters in the last month in a plane crash in Arizona, and five were seriously injured last week battling the Devil's Creek fire in Montana.
It's -- to state the obvious, and you governors know it better than anybody -- it is really, really dangerous work, and it takes incredible bravery to do it. And these heroes deserve to be paid -- and paid well -- for their work. That's why, last month, I was able to announce -- and it's not paying that well, in my view, to be honest with you -- immediate action to make all federal firefighters making at least $15 an hour. I think they deserve more than that.
We're also working with Congress to make sure that our firefighters are paid better permanently. Permanently. So far, FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help states pay for the cost of fighting these fires.
We're also working with FEMA and the Defense Logistical Agency to get ahead of this emergency supply chain challenges. And we still have some supply chain challenges relating to hoses and a number of other things.
We're trapped -- we've tapped additional aircraft from the Department of Defense to aid in the fire detection and firefighting. We also welcome the support of our allies, from Australia, for example, sending a large air tanker to which it's going to begin flying missions this week.
And last month, I also noted that the EPA would be launching an upgrade app for mobile phones to easily share location-specific information with the public about the effects of fire and smoke on air quality for them. It's now even more important, because smoke from many of these fires burning in the West and along the Canadian border is affecting air quality in states across the country.
As of today, the upgrade app -- the upgrade AirNow app is live and ready for use. Folks in affected areas should download this important tool as quickly as possible.
I also encourage our states and county leaders to continue partnering with FEMA, as many of the leaders on the scene today are leveraging our Public Alert and Warning systems to communicate information directly and quickly about -- to the public about wildfires, evacuations, power outages, and more.
I know several of the governors' states have used this system recently and send -- to send warnings of evacuation orders, and it has undoubtedly helped people and, we don't know for certain, but likely saved some lives.
But we're in for a long fight yet this year, and the only way we're going to meet those challenges is by working together.
Wildfires are a problem for all of us and we have to stay closely coordinated in doing everything we can for our people. That's why I asked the governors to join us -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- so they can update me and the Vice President directly on what they need and what we can possibly do more of. And so we can discuss what's needed today -- we have to meet an urgent danger at hand -- a plan for what we can do to make sure we're better prepared next time.
One of the important aspects of the -- of the bipartisan infrastructure deal that is before the Senate now is it includes billions of dollars -- billions of dollars -- to strengthen wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response.
It includes funding for prevention efforts, like forest management, and to restore millions of acres of high-risk areas to protect homes and public water sources for drinking. And -- you know, and overlaying all of this is the necessity to successfully confront climate change.
We may -- we have some significant changes we're making in these two pieces of legislation that, God willing, will pass in the next month or so.
But we can't ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors of extreme heat, prolonged drought, and supercharged wildfire conditions are affecting the country.
And so, this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action, both today and, as you all know better than anyone else in the country, not just today, but tomorrow, next year, and the year after.
And so, I want to thank you, Governors, for your leadership during what is an incredibly challenging period for all of you. God, love you. You're going through -- anyway. It's --
And I'd like to ask, now, the Vice President to make a few comments. And then, I have some questions for all and we get in a discussion, with your permission. Thank you.
Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President.
We stand with you. We stand with you, and this is a commitment from our administration that we will not only stand with you, but stay in touch with you, mostly to hear from you. We know that the way that we can help you manage and expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have -- the federal and state government, along with local governments.
This -- this issue is ongoing. Each year, as we have discussed, it gets worse. It affects real people -- everything from children who are breathing the smoke to parents who are up at night, concerned that they may get an evacuation order at any -- at any moment. So, know that we are here to maximize the federal capacity to support the states.
I'm in D.C., but, of course, I'm a California girl and I care deeply about this. We -- as I think I've shared with many of you, our family has been under evacuation orders in the last couple of years. And -- and our folks should not have to fear that they are -- they are going to lose their home, everything they have, much less risk their lives in these moments.
So, thank you all for your courage, for your leadership, and I look forward to staying in touch with you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Folks, I asked the staff -- because I think it's -- I've had the great honor of being, over the last 15 years, in your states and in the wilderness areas and the national parks. And I asked my staff to put together maps where exactly where the fires are and the areas they're in and what they're affecting.
And so, I want to start off with you, Governor Gianforte, up in Montana. You have your hands full, man. And I -- looking at -- at the map, all away from, you know, Poverty Flats and Crooked Creek, all the way up into Ruby and Hay Creek, and the other end of the state. But the big fires look like they're in Trail Creek and Alder Creek -- in those areas that are significant.
And I got -- I have a simple question, and it's a complicated one, but what can we do for you that -- that we're just not getting done now? What additional help can we give you now that -- that is not -- not there yet?
I mean, cut through all the -- all the jargon about, you know, all that we policy wonks are talking about various programs. Bottom line: What do you need and can we help -- you know, that we haven't?
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: Good morning, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you, and I want to answer your question because there are some things we can do to collaborate and work closer together.
Just to give a moment of background: As we meet this morning, our heroic firefighters are confronting 19 largescale fires in Montana alone.
And to put that in perspective: Just since January 1st, we've had 1,600 fires start in Montana and we've burned about 220,000 acres. These wildfires threaten the safety of our communities.
That Poverty Flats fire that you mentioned, in the last week, burned from initial start to 65,000 acres currently threatening 1,200 households out in the Big Horn County area, our first responders. These devastate our local communities and the costs keep mounting. We've spent -- the state has spent $13 million since July 1st alone.
It could have been much worse. And this gets to your question, Mr. President. Without our state's commitment -- and we've shared this with Forest Service and BLM, and they've been very cooperative -- to aggressive initial attack, Montana -- without that commitment, we would have had many more largescale fires. And we ask that our federal partners join us in applying this operating principle. Whether it's a fire that starts on private, state, or federal land --
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: -- fires are easier to manage when they're smaller.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mm-hmm.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: And when we get after them, we do much better.
As we continue to confront this wildfire season, we're also focused on addressing Montana's forest health crisis. We published, earlier this year, the Montana Forest Action Plan, which identifies 9 million acres of forest land with significant forest health issues and an elevated risk of wildfire. Of those acres at risk, we found about 4 million acres that would benefit most from cross-bounty [sic] -- boundary forest management.
Given the need to actively manage our forests, I've charged our Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to double the number of acres it treats with active forest management this year at 25,000 acres.
But this is just a starting point. We'll actively manage private, state, and federal land with a variety of treatment types, including thinning, logging, and prescribed burn.
We've also invested in 14 different cross-boundary projects in Montana this year. These projects demonstrate the importance of working together across ownership -- ownership boundaries to create meaningful, landscape-scale change. And using funds from the state's fire suppression account and the Forest Service State and Private Forestry Division, we'll expand existing work and jumpstart new activities.
But it's not up, totally, to us. We ask that our federal partners join us in doing what needs to be done year-round to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
Of the 9 million acres at high risk, 60 percent of those are on federal land. This makes tools like the Good Neighbor Authority and stewardship contracting more important than ever.
The benefits are really clear: We have healthier forests, improved wildlife habitats, more recreational opportunities, and more good-paying jobs, and, most importantly, less severe wildfires. Without active forest management, we can't be successful in our forest health improvements.
In closing, I just want to say -- I want to thank our federal partners. We have good collaborative relationships here in Montana with the Forest Service and BLM. I also want to thank Governor Newsom and Governor Cox for sending crews to help us deal with these fires that are currently burning. We have thousands of first responders on the frontlines, right now, protecting our communities, natural resources, and livelihoods across Montana, across the western United States.
So many people have sacrificed, and I can't thank them enough. We can't measure it in dollars spent or acres burns -- burned. We have to keep them and their loved ones in our thoughts and our prayers.
I agree with you, Mr. President. Now is the time to act. I think it's all about aggressive initial attack and getting more proactive in our forest management.
Again, Mr. President, Vice President Harris, I want to thank you for letting me join you today.
THE PRESIDENT: Greg, let me ask you another question, if I may. There's press in the room, and lots of times, I know I do and we all do, use terms which those of us who are in public office -- whether it's President, Senator, Governor, et cetera -- use, and I don't think -- understandably, the American people don't fully understand what they mean. And -- and even I -- sometimes the press has so much to cover, I'm not sure they --
You talked about the Forest Health Plan. And talk about, as I say to my staff all the time, in plain English, what's that mean. Explain a little bit what that means.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: Sure. So, we have many forests in Montana that have not had good stewardship. The growth has gotten to the point -- I can take you 10 miles west to the state capital in Helena and show you a federal forest where 90 percent of the trees are standing dead. They've been killed by beetle when --
THE PRESIDENT: Right. Right.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: And this really creates a tinderbox situation. It reduces habitat. So. very -- very little wildlife lives there. And when we get a lightning strike or a campfire out of control and a fire starts in a forest like that, we put firefighters at risk. They're very hard to control.
The state has been very proactive. We -- the state has about 5 million acres. We've been very active in being stewards of those grounds. And when we thin a forest -- this is not clear cuts --
THE PRESIDENT: Right.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: -- but when we thin, when we remove excess fuels, water comes back into surface streams, wildlife comes back into that community. And when wildfire goes through a managed forest, it doesn't then get into the crown. It doesn't burn as hot. We don't have the devastation. And structures aren't threatened. So everybody wins when we have good stewardship of the forest.
THE PRESIDENT: That's really important. I -- believe it or not, I knew that. But that's really important for people to get it. Because we talk about thinning out the forest. We're talking about a lot of trees, because of climate change as well, where you have bugs, insects, eating up the trees as well, making things that -- that are changing and killing the forest themselves, and they become real tinder. And it's like, you know, dropping a match in a -- you know, in -- almost like in a pool of fuel.
And so going in and cutting all that out is not the same as going in -- I'm glad you made the point of clear cutting -- going in and just --
So I -- look, we do have, and we're -- I'm hopeful that we're going to get a lot of the infrastructure plan passed and the Recovery Act that has a lot of money in here to help you all manage these forests and to have much more money in there for the -- for the Bureau of Land Management -- anyway -- to be able to give you the help you need. Because your state, which I've been through, is a magnificently beautiful state.
It's -- and, I mean -- and the thing -- you know, you -- I come from the state of Delaware. And, you know, you had -- we had more acreage burned last year than the state of Delaware and Maryland combined -- combined. For you all out in Montana, that ain't (inaudible). (Laughs.) But I want people to get a sense of how massive -- how massive these fires are and how they affect water systems and --
Anyway, but that's -- I'm sorry to take your time, but I wanted you to be able to explain that so people understand that are listening to this.
Let me ask you -- let me ask you, Governor Inslee: You know, you've been talking about the impacts of environmental change for a long, long time. And one of the things -- and I asked him to show me -- to get me a map of where all your fires are in your state. And when you have Delancy and Cub Creek 2 and Cedar Creek -- I mean, they're massive fires. Massive.
And what are -- you know, as you look at what's transpired over the past month and you look at the road ahead of this wildfire scene, what is your biggest concern, Jay? What is your biggest concern? And again, I ask you the same question: What is the thing we can do most? I mean, you go all the way from Delancy down to ""Lil' Crick,"" as they say -- in the Creek -- you know down in the southwest -- southeast part of your state. What are -- what are your biggest concerns?
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Well, first off, thanks for your leadership, Mr. President. It is so refreshing to have a President who really cares about the Western Forest.
My biggest concern might surprise you because all of the governors share these immediate concerns. We have a huge need for additional aerial assets, additional dozer bosses so we can get our dozers into fire lines. We need new tra- -- more trained people. We do have an emerging concern about our fuel supply for our aerial assets. Everything we need to fight forest fires is in dire need across the Western United States, not just in Washington State. We've had a thousand fires. It's burned four times more at this time of year than normal. We've had two and a half times more acreage burn in the last decade than the previous.
So those are the obvious concerns. And everything you need to fight a fire, we -- we could use your help on. And I think you've been totally on top of this, and so I thank you for your leadership on all of these things, including management issues. There's unanimity, there's bipartisan acceptance of the need for active management. We're acti- -- we're managing our forests, just like Montana is, to try to get in and reduce fuel.
But here's the surprising thing, when you asked me this question, or the thing that I worry most about: The thing I worry most about is if, for some reason, the Congress did not follow your leadership in this reconciliation and infrastructure bills that allowed you to realize your vision of creating millions of jobs while fighting climate change. That's my biggest worry right now. Because the fact of the matter is there is nothing in human intervention against these fires while climate continues to ravage our forest.
You know, we used to think of these things are forests. They really, now, just fields of fuel, and they're fields of fire with just one spark because they're so dry. And that aridity creates something like gasoline on the floor of our forest.
There is only one way to prevent these forests from being gone in the la- -- in the next century effectively, to be totally unrecognizable, and that is to succeed in following your vision in the reconciliation bill for a clean energy standard, for a huge transition to the electrification of our transportation fleet, to a civilian climate corps.
And so, I want to tell you we are going to be with you, as you stand tall, while you negotiate this reconciliation bill to say, ""Look, we have to have those climate investments. There is only one way to save these forests from the ravages of climate.""
Our own federal scientists have said that if we accept a one-degree centigrade change, we'll have 600 percent increase in these fires on a regular basis. We won't recognize these forests as forests anymore unless we succeed with your vision.
So when you start having those discussions with Mr. Klain and Steve Ricchetti and everyone else at the end of the reconciliation process, you got to know you're going to have an army behind you standing tall for those things.
Now, there's some other small things that I'm talking to your staff about, about having better independent assistance for towns like Malden that burned down. There's some other coordination.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR INSLEE: But that's the thing that's going to ultimately decide whether these forests survive in the next century.
Thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you for saying that. But, you know, one of the things that I say to all your colleagues: When I -- when it was proposed to me by some folks that we should have a Civilian Climate Corps of thousands of young people trained to do these things and -- at first, it didn't -- you know, I said, ""Yeah, yeah, that sounds good."" And then I started looking at it.
And the truth of it is, it's not fundamentally different, in terms of the help it can provide across the board training a lot of these -- I'm talking about thousands of young people getting paid to be trained and trained well for a very -- it's not -- it's not fundamentally different than the Civilian Corps put together in the Depression that was -- had a different purpose. They were building a building. They were doing a whole range of things.
But I just think I'd encourage -- and also, we'll send it to all of you. But all you governors -- Democrat, Republican -- take a look at it and see if you think I'm -- you know, I may have -- you know, as my mother would say, my eyes are bigger than my stomach. You know that I may have a bigger appetite.
But I -- I really think it can -- can be helpful. And there -- again, I say to your colleagues, there's a lot of money in here to be able to deal with your immediate needs as well.
But, anyway. Thanks, Jay. And I'll get -- I know you have this, but I want to get --
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: -- more of it to you.
And, Gavin, I -- or, Governor, you know, I applaud your your -- your establishing the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force, which I've learned is co-chaired by your Secretary of Natural Resources. I think it's a great example of being able to coordinate federal, state, local because this is getting real -- this is -- this is getting -- this is -- this needs a lot of coordination.
And I understand that PG&E, which provides electric to 17 million of your folks -- I understand they recently announced underground 10,000 miles of power lines. Is that -- is that true? And what's that going to do to the cost of energy in your state? And -- I mean, because that's expensive stuff.
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: It's a million to three and a half million dollars a mile to --
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: -- underground in California. Do the math on 10,000 miles.
Of course, do the math on decades of neglect. Ten thousand miles is a drop in the bucket. They have 106,000 miles of distribution line. Twenty-five thousand just in high-risk, fire-prone areas which will only grow. That's a 10-year commitment. It's important, but I want to put it in perspective.
I also want to put something else in perspective. Your eyes, Mr. President, are not wider than your stomach. California is proving your theory. Over a year and a half ago we established the Climate Corps in this state. It's inspiring beyond words. It's also inspired the philanthropic sector --
THE PRESIDENT: It really is, isn't it? I mean, it's not a joke. It is inspiring when you see it. I mean, it's incredible, I think. But --
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: Absolutely. And it's the one thing this country needs more than anything else, and that's common experiences and to focus on the things that bind us together, not just divide us.
This transcends politics. We have kids from urban and rural parts of the state, across every conceivable difference, and they're advancing together in ways that truly are awe-inspiring.
So, Mr. President, that's -- that's a vision we can manifest. We're not asserting it; we're proving it.
In a small way, you have the opportunity to do it in -- at scale.
Look, I just want to briefly -- because there's so many of us -- a quick update. We're blowing past every record, and not in a good way. We're at over 5,700 fires year-to-date. We suppressed 59 just yesterday with some initial attacks. Over half a million acres already burned in California.
To put in perspective -- a record-breaking year. Last year, we were at 130,000 acres burned. We're at 504,000 as I speak to you today.
Here's the answer to your question. And forgive me for being so pointed again, respecting your time, but I want to be a little bit more specific.
Jay referenced it obliquely. Please pay attention to this fuels issue. We had to get our National Guard to get some emergency fuel supplies for our aerial fleet a week ago. This is a major issue, and it's not just impacting our aerial suppression strategies on the West Coast. It's increasingly, as you may know, impacting commercial aviation. It is a major issue.
Number two, we just simply need more boots on the ground. We can't do without you. We've got 7,400 people -- 7,400 already. We're not in fire season. Fire season in California is late September, October, into November. We're in July. We already have 7,400 personnel actively working to suppress fires.
Last year, the federal government asked us for over 5,000 mutual aid support that we could not provide. That gives you a sense of what the federal government wanted from California last year to send to other states. That should give you a sense of how far behind we are with federal support.
We have four DC-10s, Mr. President. Four. Now, DC-10s aren't the answer to every problem. They don't fly over 35 knots. They have restrictions; there are legendary restrictions. But the reality is there is four for the country, and we're competing. They're all contracted. We compete with you. We compete with other states. We don't even have access right now to DC-10s.
We lost that 747 -- that iconic 747 -- that now has been converted to a cargo plane. You've seen that in Australia, not just across the West Coast. That's now been grounded by a private contractor.
We are the largest civil aviation fleet for firefighting in the world -- California. We do not come close to having the tools in the air that we need. We need your support to su- -- to dramatically increase the aerial support, in addition to boots on the ground.
Final two quick points: Every year, we're competing -- and you have a lot of legislators that have been doing heroic work in Democratic states, governors -- and Republican states -- trying to get access to the Pentagon satellite technology for early detection. It's been a game changer for us. And we're getting it on a year-to-year basis, but it's hard. Every year, we fight to get a one-year extension on that access to a critical tool of technology.
I'd encourage you to help us so we're not just fighting every year for something that I think you would support and the Pentagon, at the end of the day, final analysis will approve.
But here's the final thing, and it's the elephant in the room. I was with Governor Sisolak two days ago in his state of Nevada. The reason why is we had a fire that was on federal property. Fifty-seven percent of the forest property in California is federal, just three percent under California jurisdiction. Three percent. Fifty-seven percent under U.S. Forest Service. U.S. Forest Service is spectacular. We have deep admiration and respect, but there's a culture that, too often, is, ""Wait and see."" We can't afford that any longer. This was a federal fire. They waited. And what we saw is the fire took off because we didn't put enough initial assets.
Greg was making an oblique point here. I want to be a little bit more explicit: We need your help to change the culture, in terms of the suppression strategies, in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.
That fire bled into Nevada and, obviously, impacted not just our two states, but deeply impacted the redundancy of this concern that comes out every year around jurisdictions and incident command and the imperative that we're all on the same page, in terms of those initial attack strategies.
So, forgive me for being longwinded, but I wanted to get those clear --
THE PRESIDENT: No, no that's -- that's why we're doing this. I want to find out what -- what's the greatest concerns you have.
And I will -- when this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite capability.
And -- but -- I'm looking down the list here. All right, I will follow up with you, Gov -- or the Vice President will; she has a mild interest in California -- with all the points you just raised, and I -- and I do appreciate it.
Now, I want to get to each one of you, but we're going to ask the -- I think now is the time the press is going to leave the room. Am I correct?
(Press is ushered out.)
","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks with the Vice President in a Virtual Meeting with Governors on Wildfires Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/351313"
"July 29, 2021",Remarks on Efforts to Combat the Spread of the COVID-19 Delta Variant and an Exchange with Reporters,"
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Today, I want to talk with you about COVID-19.
Maybe the best way to start is: In a significant part of the country, you wouldn't have to take one of these off, you don't have to put one on -- like in my home state of Delaware, where I lived in New Castle County, where I was yesterday in Pennsylvania -- because people got vaccinated. They got vaccinated. They don't need a mask when the majority -- the vast majority of people got vaccinated.
Now, look, I want to talk about what's really happening -- what it means, what it doesn't mean, and what we need to do this week and the months ahead.
From the moment I was elected, I said I'd always give it to you straight from the shoulder, and we need some straight talk right now. Because there's a lot of fear and misinformation in the country, and we need to cut through it with facts, with science, with the truth.
So, what's really happening today?
After months and months of cases going down, we're seeing a spike in COVID cases. They're going up. Why? Because of this new form, this new variant called the ""Delta variant.""
This is a much different variant than the one we dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases in those who are not vaccinated.
Our experts tell me that cases will go up further
before they start to come back down. But while cases are on the rise, they're not -- we're not likely to see, according to experts, a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
So, you have to ask yourself: Why is that? Because 164 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of those most vulnerable -- our seniors.
So, there's a challenge, as we knew there could be. But there's also good news.
We've spent the last six months preparing for this possibility. The vaccines are highly effective. We have enough vaccine for everyone to get vaccinated.
And thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the hard work of the American people, we've administered over 325 million vaccination doses in the past six months.
We have the tools to prevent this new wave of COVID from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw happen last year.
I've said from the beginning that we will be guided by the science. So here's what the science tells us:
On Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention -- the CDC -- announced its new mask recommendation in parts of the country where COVID cases are substantially high, where people didn't get vaccinated -- which they define as 50 new cases for every 100,000 people in a week.
The CDC recommends you wear a mask when you're in public and indoors, like work or in a grocery store. That's true for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. Why? Because even if you've been fully vaccinated and protected from severe illness from COVID-19, you could have the Delta variant in your system
and spread it to someone who isn't vaccinated.
We need to wear masks to protect each other and to stop the rapid spread of this virus as we work to get more people vaccinated.
And I hope all Americans who live in areas with substantial or high case rates will follow the mask guidance that's being laid down by the CDC. I certainly will. And I have -- because this is one of those areas, in Washington.
And at my decision -- at my direction, all federal personnel and visitors to federal buildings will have to do the same thing.
As I've said from the beginning, a mask is not a political statement; it's about protecting yourself and protecting others. Masking is one defense against the spread of COVID-19.
But make no mistake: Vaccines are the best defense against you getting severely ill from COVID-19 -- the very best defense.
And you want to know how we put this virus behind us? Well, I'll tell you how: We need to get more people vaccinated.
Look, and it's important to understand what vaccines do and what they don't do. Put simply, the vaccines are designed to save lives and prevent severe illness. They're highly effective at both.
A hundred and ninety million Americans have had at least one shot. Of that group, about 90 percent are done now, and 10 percent are waiting for the second shot.
To those folks who have one shot but not the second: Go get the second shot. Even if you're overdue for the second shot, it is not too late. Go get the second shot now. Now.
The bottom line is: If you're fully vaccinated, you're highly protected from COVID-19. But I also know that many of you who are vaccinated are concerned about what's called ""breakthrough cases."" Yes, some fully vaccinated people will still test positive, and some will show some symptoms of COVID-19. That's expected with almost every vaccine there is for other diseases.
But breakthrough cases remain rare and almost all are mild cases. In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.
I also know many of you are wondering if you'll need a booster shot to add another layer of protection. As of now, my medical advisors say the answer is no. No American needs a booster now.
But if the science tells us there's a need for boosters, then that's something we'll do. And we have purchased the supply -- all the supply we need to be ready if that was called for.
Folks, the truth is, as more people get vaccinated, we are better protected as a nation to continue reopening safely and responsibly.
But we are not fully out of the woods yet, because what is happening in America right now is a pandemic -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Let me say that again: It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
There are about 90 million Americans who are eligible to get the shot but haven't gotten it yet. As I just mentioned, nearly all of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 today are from unvaccinated people.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths had been among the unvaccinated -- 99 percent. This is an American tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. If you're out there unvaccinated, you don't have to die.
Read the news and you'll see stories about unvaccinated patients in hospitals. As they're lying in bed, dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" And the doctors have to say, ""Sorry, it's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching someone they love dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated, if I just…"" It's heartbreaking. And it's complicated even more because it's preventable.
America is divided between the majority of eligible people who are vaccinated and those who are not. And I understand that many of you in the majority are frustrated with the consequences of the failure of the minority to get vaccinated.
But I want you to know that I'm going to continue to do everything I can to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. That includes addressing hesitancy and misinformation head on.
For example, I know some of you are -- who are unvaccinated think, ""The development of vaccine was rushed, therefore I'm not going to take a chance. As a result, I think it's not safe because it was rushed."" I understand.
But let me explain. Our top scientists at the National Institute of Health -- the NIH -- and across the country got to work applying decades of research -- decades of research -- let me repeat that: decades -- that have already been done -- the research -- to develop the COVID-19 vaccine when it hit.
In the last six months, more than 325 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the United States and billions of doses administered around the world. The vaccine was developed and authorized under a Republican administration, and has been distributed and administered under a Democratic administration.
The vaccines are safe, highly effective. There's nothing political about them. Look at all the people who took a shot at it. They later -- we learned a lot of them have already been vaccinated.
From the start, I have to compliment Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He hadn't made it political. He's encouraged people to get vaccinated and is continuing to do so, and his state is in pretty good shape.
Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey recently spoke out to encourage vaccination.
And even the commentators on Fox who have been belittling this for a long time -- some haven't, but many have -- are arguing, ""Get vaccinated.""
Look, this is not about red states and blue states. It's literally about life and death. It's about life and death. That's what it's about.
You know -- and I know people talk about freedom. But I learned, growing up at school and from my parents, with freedom comes responsibility. Your decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else.
Unvaccinated people spread the virus. They get sick and fill up our hospitals. And that means if someone else has a heart attack or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.
If you're unvaccinated, you put your doctor and nurses at risk -- the same frontline, essential workers who put their lives on the line over the past year and have gone through hell.
Again, with freedom comes responsibility. So, please, exercise responsible judgement. Get vaccinated -- for yourself, for the people you love, for your country.
I'm being literal when I say this: As I travel the world, almost every day a foreign leader calls me, asking can I provide his or her country more vaccines. Their people are desperate for vaccines.
I'm doing everything to answer those calls. We're sending millions of vaccines to people around the world. But, folks, it's an American blessing that we have vaccines for each and every American. We've made it our first and top priority to have available vaccines for every eligible American and that's never going to change as long as I'm here.
And it's a shame -- it's just such a shame to squander that blessing. That's why after six months of extraordinary work and effort, today I'm laying out additional steps we should be taking to deliver these lifesaving vaccines to more Americans.
First, we're going to provide more incentives to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated. That starts with paid leave to get the shot. We're still hearing that people are unable to get time off from their employer to get vaccinated. Well, this is unacceptable.
For some time now, I've said you should be able to get the shot and still get paid. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the federal government is fully reimbursing any small- or medium-sized business that provides workers with paid time off to get vaccinated.
Employers, this costs you nothing. If you haven't given employees paid time off, do it now, please.
Today, I'm announcing that we're taking this a step further. The federal government will now reimburse those employers to give their staffs -- who give their staffs time off not only to get themselves vaccinated, but also to get their family members vaccinated.
That means employers can get reimbursed if they give parents time off -- with paid time, paid leave -- to take their kids or their own parents to get vaccinated. So, I'm calling on all employees [employers] across the country to give paid time off to get the shot or to help a family member do so. I promise you: It will cost you, the employer, nothing. You'll be reimbursed.
Secondly, I'm announcing that we'll continue the work -- to work with states to encourage unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. In February, the grocery store chain Kroger's offered $100 to their associates if they'd get vaccinated. And it worked. Vaccination rates moved up from 50 cent [sic] -- 50 percent to 75 percent among their employees.
States like New Mexico, Ohio, and Colorado are offering similar incentive programs that have helped increase vaccination rates.
So, today, I'm calling on all states and local governments to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan, to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.
I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who've gotten vaccinated already, but here's the deal: If incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them. We all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated.
But in addition to providing incentives to encourage vaccination, it's time to impose requirements on key groups to make sure they're vaccinated. (Clears throat.) Excuse me.
Just this week, we took an important step to protect our veterans. Like many civilian hospital systems are doing, the Department of Veterans Affairs will now require COVID-19 vaccines for doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers who provide medical care for our veterans.
We must do everything possible to protect our veterans from getting COVID when they come to get medical care they so richly earned serving their country. We owe them.
Next, since many vaccinations are required for active duty military today, I'm asking the Defense Department to look into how and when they will add COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations our armed forces must get.
Our men and women in uniform who protect this country from grave threats should be protected as much as possible from getting COVID-19.
I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent.
Next, every federal government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work; test one or two times a week to see if they have a -- they have acquired COVID; socially distance; and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
Likewise, today, I'm directing my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
Look at the Chamber of Commerce representing tens of thousands of American businesses. The National Association of Manufacturers. The Business Roundtable, which is comprised of the largest and biggest corporations in America. They're all applauding the actions the federal government is taking, and I urge them to follow suit.
I also commend the National Football League that has announced that if there are outbreaks among unvaccinated players and personnel, then the team risks forfeiting games. I urge other sport leagues at every level to take every step they can.
Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates. And the Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.
We all want our lives to get back to normal, and fully vaccinated work places will -- will make that happen more quickly and more successfully. We all know that in our gut. With incentives and mandates, we can make a huge difference and save a lot of lives.
I also want to speak to families with children in school. We can and we must open schools this fall full time. It's better for our children's mental and emotional wellbeing, and we can't afford another year out of the classroom. Every school should be open, and we're giving them the tools to be able to do so safely. Even in those areas where they have a higher vaccination -- they have a higher rate of COVID.
Through the American Rescue Plan, we've provided schools billions of dollars to implement safety measures: better ventilation, social distancing, and other measures.
In March, when vaccinations were scarce, I prioritized teachers and school workers by utilizing our Federal Pharmacy Program. Almost 90 percent of educators and school staff are now vaccinated.
Additionally, the CDC has provided clear guidance on how all schools can safely protect the kids and bring them back to the classroom: every student wear a mask. It's that simple.
So, we've funded safety measures at schools, we've vaccinated teachers and staff, and we can mask up our kids for further protection.
But once again, there's one more thing we need to do: Get more adolescents, ages 12 and up, vaccinated now that they've been cleared. In the past week, the good news is we're seeing the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting vaccinated go -- increase 22 percent per day.
Today, I'm asking school districts to host one last pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks for kids ages 12 and up. We're directing the Federal Pharmacy Program to help make that happen.
Parents, get your children vaccinated. You do it for so many other things right now.
And for kids under 12, if and when the vaccines are deemed safe for them, we'll be prepared to get the vaccines administered as quickly and as safely as possible.
Look -- and as we work to vaccinate more Americans, we're prepared for outbreaks in areas of -- where there are unvaccinated people.
My administration has made it clear to every governor that more federal resources are available to them. This includes the deployment of surge teams composed of ex- -- experts from the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- the FEMA.
We're going to continue to provide states with more testing, treatments, protective equipment, personnel, mobile vaccination clinics to stem the surge of the virus among the unvac- -- unvaccinated.
The pictures of hospitals in several states overloaded with patients is unnecessary, avoidable, and tragic. You know, we'll help any health system overloaded and unable to cope with a spike in cases. We're ready to do that.
Let me close with this: If you're at home and vaccinated but anxious or even angry, or if you're at home and unvaccinated, unbothered and unconvinced, let's step back and see where we are.
Just remember how we've emerged from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer. But really remember just how dark that winter was.
Over 3,600 Americans were dying each and every day. And now, even with the surge among the unvaccinated, we're down to that -- 300 Americans a day. Significant.
Millions of people were out of work, out of homes, out of hope, and going hungry. Remember those long lines of people in their automobiles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk?
Experts and pundits said we couldn't get the vaccines. And even if we could get the vaccines, we couldn't get them in people's arms and couldn't get them vaccinated. They predicted our economy would collapse. But remember how we stayed focused and how we went to work?
In six months, we got 164 million Americans fully vaccinated. And because we vaccinated so many people, put in place so many safety measures, and got economic help to businesses and people most in need, our economy is recovering.
More than 3 million Americans are back to work since I was sworn in -- a faster job growth than any previous administration. Any.
We're experiencing the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades. The best in the world as of now.
In fact, today's GDP numbers show that in the first half of the year, our economy grew faster than any point in nearly 40 years. Our economy grew more in six months than most Wall Street forecasters expected for the entire year before we implemented our plan.
And just yesterday, we announced a bipartisan infrastructure deal that's going to continue this momentum over the long term by making the most significant investment to rebuild America in nearly a century.
But we still have to face many challenges. We still have a lot of work to do as we readjust to a post-pandemic economy. But we have the right plan. We're coming back. We just have to stay ahead of this virus.
I know this is hard to hear. I know it's frustrating. I know it's exhausting to think we're still in this fight. And I know we hoped this would be a simple, straightforward line, without problems or new challenges. But that isn't real life. We're coming out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
As I told you before, I carry a card in my pocket -- I hope I have it with me -- I have -- carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans dead from COVID-19. As of today -- this morning -- the total deaths in the United States were 609,441. Granted, the death rate per day is way down; it's down to 400, about, dead.
But that's more deaths than World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. This is as tough as it gets.
We're Americans. When we get knocked down, we get back up. That's who we are. That's what we do. That's why there's no nation on Earth like us.
And we're prepared like never before. We have the tools to save lives, to keep our economy growing and growing and going.
After the past six months, following the science, we know we can dramatically lower the cases in this country. We can do this. We brought our economy back to life, and we kept it going. We know we can send our kids back to school. We know we can beat this virus. We can do this. We all just have to do our part.
My fellow Americans, this nation has never failed when we have come together as the United States of America. So I say to all those who are unvaccinated: Please -- please get vaccinated.
And to the rest of America: This is no time to be despondent or let our guard -- our guard down. We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, with the truth. And together, as Americans, we're going to be able to beat this.
May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, how long do you think it might be necessary to wear masks? And at what point do you think people might have to have a booster shot? Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: I said it in my talk: The booster shot is not needed now. It is possible that it will be needed later. I don't know -- they don't -- the science hasn't dictated that yet. And the fir- -- first part of your question?
Q: How long do you think people might have to wear a mask again?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you notice, a lot of places, people don't have to wear masks. Let's get that straight. The places where people have gotten vaccinated, where we have a high vaccination rate, people do not have to wear a mask at all.
Like some of you were with me yesterday when I was up in Lehigh Valley. Didn't have to wear a mask there. Don't have to mask if you come home to Delaware with me -- I know you love doing that. But you don't have to wear a mask. The places people are probably going to have to wear masks: in those communities where the high rate of unvaccinated stays high and they don't move -- they don't move to getting vaccinated.
But I think you're going to find the patience of businesses and the patience of a lot of other people running thin. Because the fact is, if you had high vaccination rates, you -- we wouldn't be in the spot right now.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, will this set up a -- an American workplace for federal workers and private sector that really is the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated? And is that a pressure you're trying to harness now?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I'm not -- look, what I'm trying to do is keep people safe. I mean that sincerely.
So, if in fact you're unvaccinated, you present a problem to yourself, to your family, and to those with whom you work. Because as pointed out -- I was asked the question about, ""Why would people who have already been vaccinated get it?"" Well, you got anywhere from 2 to 3 percent, on average -- the last study done -- that can still get COVID. They don't get very sick. They don't get hospitalized. It's not serious, but they can catch it.
And the concern is they may be able to pass it on. And so, that's all being studied right now. But it's important -- thing is, if people are vaccinated, the transmission rate drops through the floor. And that's all we're trying to do.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. Why not push for vaccine mandates in states, private companies, schools? Do you want to see those entities pass vaccine mandates?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I -- I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction, and that's why I point it out. I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is -- they're able to do that legally, and they can. Local communities can do that. Local businesses can do that.
It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet.
Q: Mr. President, you said, earlier this week, that we are not headed back towards lockdowns. But if the science is evolving, how can you be so confident in that? You heard -- we heard you saying, weeks ago, that ""the virus [was] on the run,"" but Dr. Fauci has also indicated that we are headed in the wrong direction.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, you're take -- you're literally correct on everything you said, but it doesn't make -- come to the conclusion you're implying.
It is clear that if everybody is vaccinated, the existing vaccines work to prevent death, serious illness, hospitalization. Okay? If every -- so, if tomorrow I can wave a wand and every American was vaccinated, then in fact we'd be out of the woods.
Now, can something else happen a year from now? Can there be a different virus? Can there be something? It's possible. But I'm talking about COVID and the existing variants that have come forward so far.
So, it makes a -- it's a simple proposition: If you're vaccinated, you find yourself in a situation where you are -- highly unlikely, even if you somehow get the virus; very small percentage do -- that you are not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be on a ventilator, you're not going to be sick, but you could be in a position to possibly spread it to someone who wasn't if you have it in you.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. I wanted to ask: Why not require that the people show proof that they're vaccinated? And also, if you could just -- with the 4 million, how much of an impact do you think this will have? Do you have a projection, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: A projection on what?
Q: On how many people will get vaccinated by putting in this system?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I can't -- I'm not going to get in business of projecting -- I -- exactly how many people are likely. All I know is that we go through these periods, then we run up against a wall, then something happens where people realize, ""Oh, my lord, this is really a problem,"" and they begin to see things.
Look, the fact that a lot of your friends are now saying, ""Get vaccinated,"" who were -- before were saying, ""This is not a problem. This is all a Democratic thing."" With a small ""d"" and a capital ""D."" I mean, there's a lot changing. People are becoming aware. The more aware they become, then we have these surges of people going out and getting vaccinated --
Q: But what about requiring proof --
THE PRESIDENT: -- and it just keeps building.
Q: I'm sorry, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: What about what?
Q: What about requiring proof, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that is -- there's two ways to do it, and I think you're going to see some institutions doing that. Like you're going to fly abroad, you got to -- you're going to have to have proof. You're not just going to be able to say, ""Yeah, I got tested."" You got to pri- -- provide proof.
My guess is: If we don't start to make more progress, a lot of businesses and a lot of enterprises are going to require proof for you to be able to participate.
In the back. And then I'm going to take off, shortly here.
Q: What further actions are you going to take to encourage private businesses to follow this type of model to either require vaccines or require testing or other preventative procedures?
THE PRESIDENT: I just did. And I'm going to keep at it. I'm going to be talking about it around the country. I'm --
Q: Are you -- but are you going to reach out to private businesses, meet with them, try and actively encourage them to follow this model?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have. That's why we have folks from the -- everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the manufacturers, et cetera. So, you know, I am -- am I going to call a meeting of every, you know, business in the country to come to Washington? And -- or go on --
I have made the case repeatedly. I doubt whether there's a single, solitary business that doesn't understand that I think I think it's smart for them to require testing, require -- and if you -- if you can't demonstrate, you can't prove you've been vaccinated, you have to be tested.
Q: Secretary Austin said he was already considering mandating --
THE PRESIDENT: Yep.
Q: -- the vaccine after it was fully approved. Would you like to see the mandate go into effect before full approval? And do you think he's open to that?
THE PRESIDENT: I know he's open to it. And the question is: When is the right time to get the most bang for the buck when you do it? A lot of this is timing. And so, I think it's going to happen, but I -- look, the one thing that you all are politely and appropriately referencing is that it's still a temporary approval. So when does the final approval come? It usually takes a lot of -- a lot of work to get -- to get there.
I made a commitment I would not tell anyone in the Justice Department who they should prosecute and I would not tell the health industry that they -- excuse me, the government health entities what they should say and do. But my expectation is they're going to reach that conclusion in the early fall.
Thank you very much.
Q: Mr. President, one more. Mr. President, you said -- Mr. President, you said -- Mr. President, you said, ""If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask."" And it seems --
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't say that.
Q: You did. I have the quote.
THE PRESIDENT: I said if you're fully vaccinated in an area where you do not have -- well, let me clarify it.
Q: In May, you made it sound like a vaccine was --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, in May, that's true.
Q: -- the ticket to losing the mask forever, and it --
THE PRESIDENT: That -- that is true at the time, because I thought there were people who were going to understand that getting vaccinated made a gigantic difference. And what happen was: A new variant came along, they didn't get vaccinated, it was spread more rapidly, and people -- more people were getting sick. That's the difference.
Q: How is the First Lady, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to find out in a minute. That's why I'm leaving.

THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to be late to a very important date. If I miss this -- getting out to see my wife -- I'm in trouble.
Q: President Biden, how did your meeting on DACA go?
THE PRESIDENT: It went very well. What I think we sh- -- I think we should include in the reconciliation bill the immigration proposal. My staff is putting out a message right now.
Q: Mr. President, do you think the country will have another wave -- another peak of cases?

Q: Do you think the United States will have another wave of cases, another peak of coronavirus cases?
THE PRESIDENT: I hope not.
Q: Mr. President, did you talk to Kyrsten Sinema about the reconciliation package when you spoke to her on infrastructure the other day? She says she's not on board with the $3.5 trillion (inaudible).

"July 28, 2021","Remarks on the Importance of American Manufacturing in Macungie, Pennsylvania","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm not going to say anything; I just came to drive a truck. (Laughter.) And I'm not sure which one I want to drive. That one? There's one back in the corner you can't see. It's the biggest damn pick-up truck you ever saw in your life. (Laughter.) I tell you what.
Please, everybody have a seat. Everybody have a seat.
Carlo, thank you. And, Carlo, I'm sorry about your mom. I really am. So many -- so many people. Well over 630,000 Americans have lost their lives because of COVID. And the only thing I'm going to -- and the press keeps wanting me to talk about COVID, but I'm going to mention this one thing.
We still have a lot of people not vaccinated. The pandemic we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So, please -- please, please, please, if you're not vaccinated, protect yourself and the children out there. It's important.
And, Carlo, having been a significant consumer of healthcare myself and my family, I've often said this, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: Thank your daughter for me. If there are any angels in heaven, they're male and female nurses. Not -- that's the God's truth. Doctors let you live; they make you want to live. Spent a lot of time in ICU, with my son on a table. Tell her, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" I really mean it. (Applause.)
And I want to thank Congresswoman Wild for the passport into her district. Where are you? (Applause.) As they say up in Scranton, she's bragging on y'all. They don't say ""y'all"" up there; they say that in Delaware. (Laughter.) You do because you got family from Alabama.
And you've been a tireless champion for the working men and women of the Lehigh Valley, helping us pass a tax cut for families with children that people are seeing now in their bank accounts, showing up in their bank accounts every month, and working with our administration to expand home care for seniors. We got a generation that's a ""sandwich generation"" between the child and a mom or dad needing help. And they need help. Provide better pay for caregivers.
And I want to particularly thank Bobby Casey -- he's a great friend of mine -- who champions this cause in the Senate for eldercare.
You know, John Mack started this iconic American company in 1890. But things didn't really didn't get off the ground until four years later when he brought his William -- his brother William down from Scranton. (Laughter.)
So, it goes to show you: If you want to get things moving, bring a guy from Scranton to get it going. (Laughter and applause.)
Mind if I take my coat off? I'm going to take my coat off.
You know -- and, folks, we're getting things moving. We really are. You are.
When I started my campaign for President -- and the Gov is still -- Gov, I didn't introduce you. I apologize. No, you're the governor of this state, and you're one of the best governors in the country. Thank you. (Applause.) And you're a good friend.
When -- when I said I was running when I announced my campaign -- and not many people took it seriously -- I said I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of this country -- a sense of decency and honor; but, secondly, to rebuild the backbone of the country: hardworking, middle-class folks who built this country. And I want to point out: Unions built the middle class. (Applause.) That's not a joke. Unions built the middle class.
And, by the way, in case you regret anything, I just want you guys and women in union know that if it weren't for the UAW in 1972, I never would have won. You think I'm kidding. We had the largest percentage of union workers of any state in the nation in Delaware back then, including Michigan, because we're a small state and we had big plans. But, so -- so, before you get upset, remember, you're to blame why I got here. (Laughter.)
Look, folks, I think a lot of us come from similar backgrounds: moms, dads, brothers, sisters, family. People who get up every day, work hard, raise their families, pay their taxes, serve their communities, and serve their country.
And that's why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan shortly after I got in -- elected. (Applause.) Because we needed to act quickly and boldly to save jobs, save businesses, and save lives. And we did.
We added more than 600,000 jobs per month since I've taken office. That's over 3 million jobs all told. (Applause.) It's the fastest job growth at this point in any administration on record because of you all.
We brought this economy back from the brink: checks in people's pockets, shots in people's arms, tax cuts for working families with children. And we designed our strategy not only to provide a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.
Because when I arrived in office, we had a long time -- it's been a long time since the federal government had worked hard for working people. Things had been great for big corporations, great for the very wealthy, folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations for the past three years paid zero in federal taxes, making over $40 billion. They had no complaints.
But when I put my hand on that Bible on January 20th and took the Oath of Office, I made a commitment to the American people: We're going to change the paradigm so working people could have a fighting chance again to get a good education, to get a good job and a raise, to take care of that elderly parent and afford to take care of their children, and stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling, or waiting for slow, spotty Internet to connect them to the world.
That's what the economy we're building is all about. Because given half a chance -- and think about this; I mean this from the bottom of -- given half a chance, ordinary Americans -- the people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, just given a half a chance. (Applause.) I mean it.
You may have heard that, in Washington -- and I was just on the phone -- it looks like we reached a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure -- a fancy word for bridges, roads -- (applause) -- transit systems, high-speed Internet, clean drinking water, cleaning up and caffing [sic] -- capping the orphan wells, over thousands of them abandoned, and abandoned mines -- and a modern, resilient electric grid to build.
And guess what? A lot of those abandoned wells are leaking methane. And guess what? The same union guys that dug those wells, they can make the same union wage capping those wells. (Applause.)
And I'm working with Democrats and Republicans to get this done, because while there's a lot we don't agree on, I believe that we should be able to work together on the few things we do agree on. (Applause.) I think it's important.
In addition to the physical infrastructure, I also put forward a thing called Build Back Better plan, with investments that are going to really -- if I said to you, ""You could have the following: We're going to be -- build you a lot of new roads and bridges, or I can make sure we're going to educate your kids so we're the best educated population in the world,"" what do you think would most impact on the growth of America? You'd be the most educated nation in the world. So I'm insisting that we have universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free community college. (Applause.)
All the studies show: No matter what background a kid comes from -- whether they're a single mom, a single dad who is on what we used to call ""welfare,"" are in trouble, or come from a middle-class household -- the kid who comes from the background that's deprived is going to hear, by the time they get to first grade, a million fewer words spoken. A million fewer spoken. What that means is they're behind the eight ball from the start. And a lot more.
But we found out if you put kids in not -- not daycare but in school at age three, four, and five, it increases by 58 percent the chance, no matter what their background, they'll make it through high school and qualify to go on to community college.
Folks, we need more affordable childcare. There are a lot of women not working today because they can't get -- go back to their jobs because they have no one to take care of their children; they can't afford it.
I was a single dad for five years when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two little boys were badly banged up. I commuted back and forth to Washington because I couldn't dare leave and move to Washington because I didn't have my family to help me take care of my kids. I was making a good salary -- $42,000 a year then. And guess what? I couldn't afford care -- daycare for my children.
Eldercare: How many of you know somebody, has a mom or dad that needs help just because they're getting older and maybe still has their home but would rather stay in their home, increase their mental state, put them in a position where it's better for their health, but you can't figure out how to keep mom home alone, how to do it -- or dad? Well, eldercare is a big piece of this.
Paid leave: We're one of the only industrial countries in the world that you don't get paid leave if you have a sick son, daughter, mother, father, wife, husband, to have some time to take care of that.
Bring more people into the workforce, enhance our productivity, raise wages, and bring down the cost for working families.
You know, I was born up in Scranton, and my dad worked up in Scranton. He was actually from Baltimore, but he worked in Scranton and met my mom (inaudible) dad moved there.
And when coal died, everything died in the Valley, so he had to leave and look for a new job. My dad used to have an expression when we got down to Wilmington. First thing he did -- he got a job scrubbing the inside of boilers for a thing ca- -- often called ""COW"" -- the COW corporation.
We finally got to the place where -- we get to the place after five years we could afford to buy a small house -- actually, six years. My dad used to say, ""Remember, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I give my word to what he'd say. And it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay,"" and mean it.
Because we know that trickle-down economics has never worked. But when working families do well, everybody does well, including the wealthy. Everybody. (Applause.)
Today, I'm here to talk about a commitment that's sacred to me and central to our efforts to keep things moving. It's a straightforward solution: support and grow more American-based companies. (Applause.) Put more Americans to work in union jobs. (Applause.) Strengthen American manufacturing and secure critical supply chains. And confront the climate crisis, which is all about jobs.
I can sum it up in two words: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.
You know, what most people don't know -- no matter how informed they are, most people don't know that for literally almost a century, there's been a law on the books in America called the Buy America Act. It's supposed to make sure that when your government spends your tax dollars in buying goods that they have to be goods that were built, purchased in America.
But the previous administration didn't take it so seriously -- in previous ones, not just the last one. They were quick to say, ""You know, we have a lot of money to spend. We got to buy -- the government is going to buy everything from buildings to aircraft carriers to trucks to whatever it is. But we can't find an American company that can do it all, so we're going to have to issue a waiver. We'll hire the American company, but that American company is going to have a subsidiary overseas where non-American -- Americans don't work, where it's much cheaper, they can make more money, and they're going to say, ""We have to have that as part of the chain of building the product.""
The result has been tens of billions of dollars didn't go to jobs and businesses in communities like this one.
In recent years, ""Buy American"" has become a hollow promise. But my adma- -- my administration is going to make ""Buy American"" a reality. And I'm putting the weight of the federal government behind that commitment with Made in -- in the White House itself, we put in a Made in America Office to oversee -- not in an agency, in the White House itself -- to oversee these efforts.
In my first Cabinet meeting, I told all of the Cabinet members if their agency wants to issue a waiver -- they're buying forest -- the Forest Department is buying trucks or hoses or whatever they need, okay? They've got to buy something that's -- all of it has been made in America.
And you can't give exceptions. Because if you say, ""We can't find one that does -- has…"" They get their nozzles overseas because they don't have anybody here who can make them, et cetera. I said, ""If you're going to give an exception, you got to tell the White House specifically why the exception.""
If they still want a waiver, they have to post the request on -- publicly so American manufacturers all over the United States -- and businesses -- have a chance to look up now in a new facility and say, ""Hey, they're for companies that make nozzles. They're looking for companies that make the following whatever. We make that. We make that."" And contact us. Then they can't take the job overseas.
And today, we're going to go further: We're going to make the biggest enforcement changes to the Buy American Act in 70 years.
Right now, if you manufacture a vehicle -- I expect you guys know about that -- that gets purchased by the federal government, the law says that -- and there's about 600,000 vehicles the federal government owns, by the way, and replaces and buys -- that ""substantially all"" of that vehicle -- ""substantially all"" should be made in America.
But because of loopholes, over time, you know what ""substantially all"" means today? If 55 percent of it was made in America, you can go ahead and get all of the rest of it purchased other places. To me, 55 percent is not ""substantially all;"" it's barely half.
And this is actually a double whammy. First, 55 percent is not high enough. And second, contractors don't have to tell us the total domestic content of their products, they just have to tell us that they hit the threshold. Nobody checking. Well, they got a new sheriff in town. (Applause.) We're going to be checking. No, I'm serious. I am deadly earnest.
Today, I'm directing the Budget Office to issue a rule to raise the amount of domestic content required to be considered Made in America from 55 percent to 75 percent. (Applause.) ""Substantially all"" is going to mean substantially all.
And starting with critical products, instead of taking contractors at their word that they hit the threshold, we're going to start making them give us the details so that we can do more to support American manufacturing.
We want to be the ones making the innovative parts of every product -- the ones that will support more jobs and more small businesses.
For example, I had a tour today. A lovely lady showing me in the parts where -- the second stop we made -- she said, ""Well, we're having a little problem. We're finding we don't have the computer chips that we need to go into the engines, et cetera."" We basically don't make them anymore in America.
So, I got together with a group of 20 Republicans and Democrats. We passed a new piece of legislation providing that South Korea and Taiwan open up plants here in the United States hiring American employees to make those computer chips so we're not held hostage. (Applause.)
In case you haven't noticed, not only you but Ford Motor Company said they're going to have to stop producing certain vehicles. They couldn't get the chips. Couldn't get the wafers.
And so I'm also directing my Budget Office to create new rules for critical products where we know we need stronger, more resilient domestic supply chains. We're talking about components like semiconductors, pharmaceutical ingredients, advanced batteries, among other things.
We saw during the early days of the pandemic that the supply chain disruptions can put Americans' lives and livelihoods at risk.
When we needed them most, we were short of protective equipment, we were short on ventilators and other essential health equipment. We couldn't get the job done. We couldn't take care of people. We were short on basic equipment.
I know a lot of you in this factory stepped up to make PPE at the time. That was a noble service, but it's not a long-term solution.
Yes, we'll keep trading with our allies, but we need to have a resilient supply chain of our own so that we're never again at the mercy of other countries for critical goods ever again. Ever.
You know exactly what I'm talking about. Right here, you've seen production slowdowns. As I've said, you've had your hours cut because of the shortage of computer chips and semi-conductors.
These chips are in more than just vehicles; they enable so much of our modern lives -- our smartphones, our televisions, our medical equipment.
That's why we're investing $50 billion to have the best chip manufacturing in the world come and build factories in the United States of America. (Applause.) And it passed the Senate, and it's called the CHIPS Act, and it's part of my Build Back Better plan. And it is bipartisan, as many Republicans are concerned about it as Democrats.
It's not just semiconductors. With this rule, we'll be able to buy medical products from companies like OraSure that are up -- that are down the road in Bethlehem -- or up the road in Bethlehem, I should say. I'm used to thinking from Scranton.
Their COVID-19 tests are being made right here, bringing good jobs along with it -- meaning that we're developing a homegrown capacity to respond to this pandemic and help prepare for the next one.
And, by the way, when I say ""Buy in America,"" I mean from all America. You know, we're going to include communities that have historically been left out of government procurement, when more contracts are going to go Black and brown communities, Native Americans, small businesses, every state and territory, every industry that services and manufactures, and also agriculture.
Part of the problem is that a lot of companies don't even know these opportunities exist to be part of this. And we've got to -- and we got to know -- I used to have a great friend -- a friend who's a great friend. He used to play for Providence College back in the days when they had great teams. His name was Pete McLaughlin, and he used to have an expression. And he wasn't the -- God love him. He passed away -- needed a heart (inaudible).
But anyway, the point is that what Pete used to say -- and academics weren't his thing -- he used to say something very streetwise. He said, ""Joe, you got to know how to know."" You got to know how to know. You can walk into the Library of Congress, one of the greatest libraries in the world, and if you don't know how to use the card catalog, figuratively speaking, it's just all happenstance. You got to know how to know.
So we started a new manufacturing contracting office in the Small Business Administration to help small- and medium-sized businesses bid on these contracts. And my Department of Commerce is working to help government agencies connect with new domestic suppliers in every state. That's how we're going to build a future that's made in America.
One more reason this is going to make a big difference: Each year, the federal government purchases more than $600 billion in goods and services. The Congress passes laws for purchasing things, and as President, I get to decide where we spend them and what we purch- -- what -- I mean, I purchase what was called for, but I get to -- and I'm the one who makes the decision -- the administration makes a decision on how to spend that $600 billion.
If American companies know that we're going to be buying from them, they're going to be more inclined to hire and make key investments in the future in their companies, like you're doing here.
My Build Back Better plan has incentives for electric vehicle adaptation [adoption], for increasing the amount of clean energy our government buys. And these Buy American rules can help guarantee a reliable market.
I just saw the work you're doing on the heavy-duty electric vehicles here, like electric garbage trucks. You know, there are more than 600,000 vehicles in the federal fleet, including the majority of -- the largest portion of which are at the post office.
As we work to electrify them -- as they run out, electrify them -- we're going to be making a market for vehicles with electric, supporting both the good jobs being created, as well as innovation we need to electrify our transportation sector and clean up our environment at the same time.
And we'll be expanding my Made in America initiative to help cities, towns, and Tribes get a better deal when they buy a ""Made in America"" product. It helps the towns, the taxpayers, as well as all of you on the floor of this significant place. It really does.
There are a lot of folks out there who look at how fast and how dramatically the world is changing and world economies are changing. I mean, who would have thought that 20 years ago you'd be making electric garbage trucks here? Seriously, think about it. But they accept it as gospel that working folks aren't going to -- aren't -- are going to get left behind; they're not going to be able to keep up.
Just the opposite. It's the opposite. Hardworking Americans are the ones who are going to make it happen. We got to invest in you. We have the most productive workforce in the world here. Given half a chance, there's not a single -- single thing you can't do.
So, I reject out of hand -- I've been criticized for this for some time -- but I reject out of hand this defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't have good-paying union jobs in America.
And right here, on this factory floor, you're making a product that are fighting climate change. That's why when I hear ""climate change,"" I think jobs.
Our manufacturing future, our economic future, our solutions to the climate crisis are all going to be made in America, creating good jobs. This's what it means to build back better.
We came out of this economic crisis -- the worst since the Depression -- stronger than when we went in.
America is one of the few countries of the world -- when we get smacked and knocked down, we get up, we come back, and we come back better than we were before we got knocked down. Now, I'm not joking. Think about the -- you know, the course of history in America.
And that's why, in the American Rescue Plan that we passed shortly after I took office, we're investing considerable sums that will go to cities and towns looking to build back stronger.
For example, towns in the southwestern part of this state can now apply for funds to cap those wells that are leaking methane, clean up abandoned coal mines, invest in bringing new employers into abandoned factories, and get help attracting them.
Let me close with this: Back in 2009, during the so-called ""Great Recession,"" the President asked me to be in charge of managing that piece -- then-President Trump -- excuse me, Freudian slip; that was the last President. He caused -- anyway, that was -- President Obama, when I was Vice President.
And the American auto industry, you remember, was on the rocks. And a lot of people, including a lot of Democrats, thought it wasn't worth investing tra- -- investing in them because the American worker wasn't that good, and they were blah, blah, blah.
I remember the heat that I took -- some of you may remember as well -- when I stood up and stepped into the rescue of the American automobile industry. My name was often taken in vain on television shows a lot, because ""Why is Biden so committed to the automobile industry?"" Well, because the fundamental mistakes that were made weren't made by the workers; they were made by management.
Today, a lot of the folks who said we shouldn't rescue the American auto industry are the same folks who are saying, ""We don't need to buy American."" What those people never realized is, if you give an American worker just a chance -- a fighting chance -- there's nothing they won't do. And if you give American companies and communities the chance, there's nothing they can't build. Just look around.
From the steel that raised our cities to these trucks behind me that are going to carry the economy forward, to the workers who are the heart and soul and spine of this nation -- American strength is here. It's in this region. It's you. It's not hyperbole. It's you.
And that's why I've told every foreign leader -- and I just got back from Europe meeting with heads of state. One said to me -- I said, ""America is back."" And he said, ""For how long?"" A head of state. And I said, ""You know, I want to tell you something: It's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. We never fail when we decide we're going to do something.""
So, today, I'm placing my bet on America. I know you all are going to make sure it pays off because it will pay off with good jobs, long-term employment, the ability for America to, once again, reassert its role as the most powerful economy in the world. And that is as important as the size of our military and as anything else we do. And if we think we're not in a race, well, guess what? Take a look at China. Take a look at China.
I spent an awful lot of time with Xi Jinping, President of China -- more than, I'm told, than any other world leader has. And he's made it really clear he doesn't think democracies can compete in the 21st century. And I spent over 25 hours alone with him over the period of the last five years -- seven years.
And guess what? Just come back from a conference with Putin. He thinks the same thing. Well, I got news for them: Autocracies will not succeed if we do what we can do as a democracy. Democracies.
And if you noticed, not a joke, a lot of the rest of the world is hedging their bets whether to move toward autocracy or stay with democracies.
We have it all, folks. We have everything that we need in this country to -- not only today, but for my grandchildren -- to be in a situation where we're still the most powerful physically and most powerful economic nation in the world that treats other nations decently and maintains the peace. That's who we are. That's America.
We're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Not a joke. By that I mean: Every other nation was put together based on ethnicity or religion, geography -- but not America. America is the most unique nation in the world, and literally, we're based on the ide- -- an idea. An idea is what formed America. And the idea was -- and it sounds corny, but it is absolutely true -- no other nation has this as their organizing principle: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights…life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
We believe it. We've never accomplished it, but every generation that moved us closer and closer and closer to inclusion. That's why America's real power is not in the exercise of a military power, but people follow us because of our example. That's why the rest of the world follows us.
It was about time we get back up and reassert who we are. This is the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

"July 27, 2021","Remarks at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and an Exchange with Reporters in McLean, Virginia","
THE PRESIDENT: It's an honor to be here. I guess you all are the ones that lost the lottery, huh? (Laughter.) You had to be here in person.
Well, I'd like to thank Director Haines and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christy Abizaid, for showing me around the watch floor.
Folks, the main reason I came -- and I mean this sincerely -- is to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. The American people, almost by definition, are not able to know what you do. And you devote so much of your time, your effort, and many of you end up risking your lives in the Intelligence Community to do things to make sure that your families and people back here are safe -- make a difference.
And you'd be amazed -- as I traveled the world as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States -- how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.
I'd like to introduce you, by the way, to my National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, would you stand up? (Applause.)
And, you know, the leaders of many of our intelligence agencies are here today. And I thank you for your diligence and keeping our country safe, and your commitment to supporting your teams. Because, if there's anything, a team sport is what y'all are doing if there's going to be anything that's going to be accomplished.
Because the people I most want to honor and thank today are the intelligence professionals whose names the public is never, ever going to know, never have any notion of what you've done for us: the analysts; the linguists; the collectors and field officers; scientists; support staff; so many others who are real experts, whose careers started much longer before my administration and whose service to our nation is going to extend well beyond my presidency.
You know, you're the eyes and ears around the world -- in the frontlines of our national defense, and in many cases, for the world, through us. And you serve the American people no matter which political party holds power in Congress or the White House. It's so vital -- so vital that you are and should be totally free of any political pressure or partisan interference. That's basic.
And I want to be absolutely clear that my administration is getting us back to the basics. To the basics. I promise you: You will never see a time, while I'm President of the United States, when my administration in any way tries to affect or alter your judgments about what you think the situation we face is. I'll never politicize the work you do. You have my word on that. It's too important for our country.
Getting back to basics also making -- to make sure the IC scrupulously acts within the legal constraints and abides by our strong traditions of internal and congressional oversight, including respect for whistleblower protections.
And it also means understanding that much of the work you must do is in secret but necessary and for the sake of safety. But we should strive to be as open as possible with the American people about the nature of the threats we face and just how serious they are -- and they are.
Every one of you joined up because you believe in being part of something that's bigger than yourself, especially you guys and women in uniform -- bigger than yourself. You're patriots. It's a word that we use lightly, but I mean it. It's not -- it's not -- I don't use it lightly. I really don't.
My son, who spent a year in Iraq and died, he was a patriot. He wasn't just somebody else. You all are patriots. You risk your lives and your sacred honor for all that we need to have done for us.
And you believe in the American idea. And living up to that idea is embracing democratic values that are our greatest strength at the end of the day, leading not just by the example of our power, but by the power of your example. The power of your example.
In addition to thanking you for your bravery, integrity, and your sacrifices, I want to make it clear to everyone here today and to the members of the Intelligence Community working around the globe that you have my full confidence.
That's doesn't mean I don't question what you send me. That meant -- doesn't mean -- it's not that I -- I -- you know, I'm not a new guy on the block in terms of these issues. But one of the reasons I question is to push -- push you to the limits to determine just how certain you are about what you're doing. Lots of times, the only honest answer: ""We're not certain. We're not certain, but this is what our best judgment is.""
I know -- I really do -- know how hard the work you do is. I've been doing this for a long, long time before I became President. I know there's no such thing as 100 percent certainty in the intelligence world. Occasionally that happens, but rarely, rarely, rarely.
But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions. And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin. (Laughter.) I can tell -- one thing: I've been dealing with world leaders a long, long time. And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.
He knows that you're better than his team, and it bothers the hell out of him. Not a joke. Not a joke. And he, as a consequence of you, think we have capacities he may even exaggerate. That's a good thing. That's a good thing.
You know, one of the things I miss most during the four years between my time serving as Vice President and being a professor in a college -- and I mean this sincerely: From the time I was 31 years old, every morning I woke up and got in the train to come to -- I commuted every day from Delaware after my wife and daughter were killed. And I'd come every day, and one of the things I would get -- I'd get a brief in the morning. And I was more informed than 99 percent of the American people. You know what I miss most, for real, from those four years of being a professor? The PDB. (Laughter.) No, you think I'm joking. I am not. A sense of knowing where all the pieces were. Whether we had it all down, we knew where all the pieces were. We knew where the pieces were.
And so now I have access again -- and to the chagrin of many of you, I read it in detail. (Laughter.) And I ask questions of my briefers and follow up with my team. And I ask each of you the same thing I asked Director Haines, ""Just give it to me straight."" I'm not looking for pablum; I'm looking for straight-from-the-shoulder assessments. And when you're not sure, say you're not sure. But give me your best judgment of what you think is -- your best judgment is better than almost anybody else's judgment in the whole world -- even if the news is hard, even if the news is bad.
I can't make the decisions I need to make if I'm not getting the best unvarnished, unbiased judgments you can give me. I'm not looking to hear nice things. I'm looking to hear what you think to be the truth.
I greatly appreciate just how much work goes into the analysis that the IC produces and the tactical and intelligence supporting our warfighters and the superb effort to ensure our IT, our human capital, and the facilities are the best in the world. Because, again, without knowing what -- without you telling me, I don't know enough to know what to ask for from the Congress -- how much money we need, what we need to focus on.
It's a massive, coordinated, global effort to pull together reliable intelligence in a timely way. And all of you, no matter which agency you work for, are part of one team with one shared mission: keeping America strong and secure in the world, or simply making sure your families are safe. It gets down to basic things. Just really basic things.
You know, for most of the last 20 years, much of the work has been focused on counterterrorism, making sure the United States doesn't experience another horror like occurred on September the 11th. And that work has to continue and evolve to address the changing shape of terrorism as we find it today.
And that's no great insight on my part, it's going to change significantly more. It's going to change significantly more.
I always get kidded by my colleagues when I served in the Senate for 36 years for quoting Irish poets. They think I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason I quote them; they're simply the best poets in the world. (Laughter.)
And there's a famous poem written by -- that says, ""All has changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" The world is changing so rapidly -- technologically and in terms of alliances and human intercourse -- that war is going to change across the board in the next 10 years than in the last 50 years. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.
If I talked to you 15 years ago about hypersonic flight, you'd look at me like I was crazy. So much is going to change and that's going to put an enormous burden on you to stay ahead of the curve. It's really going to get tougher.
But we have the best folks in the world. And one of the things that I think -- and I don't want to get off too far afield here, but one of the things that is really important is -- our greatest strength, in fact, is our diversity, bringing completely different perspectives to it. And I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I'm not trying to be ""Kumbaya, everybody get along."" It's just a fact. It's a fact.
And so, threats that are more geographically dispersed than they were 20 years ago are going to continue to require our vigilance. And we have to continue our efforts to better understand some of the hardest and most important intelligence targets we face as a nation.
But, you know, we also need to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to stay ahead of security challenges that will stretch the IC in new ways it has never been stretched before.
You know, we've seen how cyber threats, including ransomware attacks, increasingly are able to cause damage and disruption to the real world. I can't guarantee this, and you're as informed as I am, but I think it's more likely we're going to end up -- well, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence. And it's increasing exponentially -- the capabilities.
When I was with Mr. Putin, who has a real problem -- he is -- he's sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else. Nothing else. Their economy is -- what? -- the eighth smallest in the world now -- largest in the world? He knows -- he knows he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous, in my view.
Take a look at China. I've spent more time with Xi Jinping as a world leader than anyone else has. I spent 25 hours alone with him when I was Vice President because it was important that, according to President Obama, that someone knew who the new guy coming on board was, and it couldn't be the President.
I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I've sat with him, with me and just an interpreter -- each of us have a simultaneous interpreter. He is deadly earnest about becoming the most powerful military force in the world, as well as the largest -- the most prominent economy in the world by the mid-40s -- the 2040s. It's real.
I don't know. We probably have some people who aren't totally cleared -- I don't know, but you saw just what we found out about hypersonic -- we -- anyway, as they say in Southern Delaware, ""This boy has got a plan."" And, you know, we better figure out how we're going to keep pace without exacerbating and moving us in a position where we increase the hostilities unnecessarily.
I think we also need to take on the rampant disinformation that is making it harder and harder for people to access -- assess the facts, be able to make decisions.
In today's PDB you all prepared for me, look what Russia is doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation. It's a pure violation of our sovereignty.
Now you see what's happening. More people get their information from the Internet than they do from any other outlet. What's -- all the disinformation that's having real consequences in terms of people's access.
And so, there's so much that you all -- particularly those of you who are new and coming along -- are going to have to be -- keep up with and ahead of in ways that are not even happening now, as good as everything is.
You know, as we compete for the future of the 21st century with China and other nations, we have to stay on top of the cutting-edge developments of science and technology.
If you'd hold for a second here, I want to point out something. You know, we used to -- we used to be, when I first got here as a U.S. senator, actually three and a half decades ago, we invested more money -- R&D -- money in R&D as a percent of our GDP than any nation in the world. We're now number eight. China was number nine; they're now number two. It matters. It matters.
Look at where we are on things that intelligence communities and others don't even think very often about -- about how educated the public is. We're coming around right now. This doesn't relate to the intelligence community per se, but it does.
Think about it. If we were having the debate that was taking place in the United States in the late 1890s and the early 1900s about public education, do you think any of us would say 12 years of free public education was enough to compete in the 21st century? Not a joke. Think about it. What do you think? I don't think there's a shot if we were doing that today.
So the fact we have the best-educated public in the world -- well, that's our objective -- will matter a great deal. It will matter a great deal. It is as much a part of national defense, in my view, as anything else is.
So I think we have to think differently. I don't expect you to agree with me. I expect you to at least understand where I'm coming from because the world is changing so significantly.
And it's especially important that we work closely with our partners and allies to maintain our technological edge; shore up supply chains; ensure that the rules that govern technologies support democracies, not autocracies.
You know, at the same time, we have to work in cooperation with nations like China and Russia that are our competitors -- and possibly mortal competitors down the road -- in the context of there's -- to meet the existential threats, for example, of climate change. There are certain things that are in our mutual interest. But we can't -- we can't be lulled into thinking that that's enough and that we don't really have to keep a watchful eye on what the ultimate objective of the other team is. But there are things where we should be -- where we should be cooperating.
This shared danger impacts all of nations. Climate challenges are already accelerating instability in our own country and around the world: extreme weather events that are more common and more deadly; food and water insecurity; sea levels rising, resulting in changing climates and driving greater migration and posing fundamental risk to the most vulnerable of communities.
If you could hold for just a second again. We're in a situation where -- think about this. Think about this: I'll never forget the first time I went down in the tank as Vice President, after I got elected. The Defense Department said what the greatest threat facing America: climate change.
If, in fact, the seas' level rises another two and half feet, you're going to have millions of people migrating, fighting over arable land. You saw what happened in North Africa. What makes us think this doesn't matter? It's not your responsibility, but it's something you're watching because you know what's going to happen.
People who were Muslim, and the only difference was Black and/or Arab, killing each other by the thousands for arable -- a piece of arable -- arable land in North Central Africa. But what happens -- what happens in Indonesia if the projections are correct that, in the next 10 years, they may have to move their capital because they're going to be underwater?
It matters. It's a strategic question as well as an environmental question.
A dramatically warming Arctic is opening up competition for resources that once were hard to access. I had -- as they say in Southern Delaware -- they talk at you like this, you know what I mean? -- I had a ""Come to Jesus"" meeting, an ""altar call"" with Mr. Putin about what he thinks is what Russia's property is in the Arctic. China looking very closely at that as well, where they are.
That's what I mean about the world changing. What is that going to do to our strategic doctrine in the next 2, 5, 10, 12 years, when you can circumvent the Arctic without icebreakers?
So, look, we need your insight, we need your expertise on all these issues. The one thing you all have in common is you all have high IQs. You're all smart. You have significant intelligence quotients, and you put it to use to help the elected leaders in this country decide what the best route to go is.
So just as you always have been essential as we've sought to counter traditional threats, the Intelligence Community is going to be critical to America's strength as we take on these new challenges and hybrid threats.
Finally, I've laid out a broad agenda, and that's just a fraction of it. But we can't do any of this without taking care of our best and most important asset: the American people.
I know the intelligence community is already one of the best places to work in the federal government. I asked my staff when I found out you came in second just after NASA -- I said, ""Don't tell me what the White House is ranked."" (Laughter.) ""It will hurt my feelings."" And they assured me, no, you don't rank them. That was a good thing: ""We don't rank the Oval Office."" (Laughter.)
But all kidding aside, it's about the comradery you have, and most of all, it's about being able to trust one another -- to trust one another.
My highest priority as President is the safety and security of all Americans, and that includes those who serve in our Intelligence Community.
You take on unique risks in these jobs, and we're taking the cases of anomalous health incidents that are affecting intelligence officers, government officials, and their families very seriously, for example.
My administration is coordinating a government-wide effort to respond to these incidents, because this challenge demands -- demands that departments and agencies, including the entire Intelligence Community, work together with urgency.
Talked about changes. What's going to happen as we move on and we're able to develop around the world pathogens that can be transmitted to societies and communities? It may not be a nuclear weapon. It may not be a hypersonic missile. It may not be any of the things we think of.
But think about it. Just think about what's happened with one -- I'm not suggesting it was intended -- a lot more we need to know -- but think what's happened: More people have been killed in the United States of America because of COVID than in every single major war we fought combined. Every single one. What's next? What is intended? There's a lot of research going on. You're going to find -- you're going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens.
So, my point is: Your value is going to increase and increase and increase and increase in terms of security. You know, from the CIA to all the agencies, there's a lot that's going to happen.
And to all of you who've been affected, we recognize how important it is to make sure that they have the best possible care at a time you're figuring out how to deal with what's happening, not only to some of those who have been stationed abroad, but their families.
Look, this is a priority for our entire leadership team. So let me just close by saying how much I value the work you do. That's why I wanted to come here today.
So much of the work you do is in secret. It means many, many times you don't get credit -- the credit you deserve -- and the things you prevented from happening, the catastrophes you've enabled us to avoid, the judgments you've provided us to make our people safer.
And America is probably never going to learn about the lives you've saved or the disasters that never come to pass because of your diligent, professional intelligence work. But I want you to know I know. For the time being, at least as long as I'm around, I know.
And on behalf of the American people, thank you all for what you do every single day. And we're grateful -- we're grateful that you're there for us. We're safer because of your dedication, your honesty, your integrity, and your significant intellectual capacity to act in our interest.
We're stronger because of your insight. We're a more noble nation because of your insight. And American lives have been saved repeatedly because of your insight. I know it may sound like hyperbole, but from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I thank you for all you do and continue to do.
And may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and all those patriots serving in harm's way, because there's a lot still there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
I have to seek permission to leave. I had to check, if you noticed. (Laughter.) Thank you again. (Applause.)
Q: President Biden, will you require federal employees to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: Beg your pardon?
Q: Will you require all federal employees to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: That's under consideration right now. But if you're not vaccinated, you're not nearly as smart as I thought you were.
Q: Are you concerned that the CDC's mask guidance could sow confusion?
THE PRESIDENT: We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they're sowing enormous confusion. And the more we learn -- the more we learn about this virus and the Delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned. And only one thing we know for sure: If those other hundred million people got vaccinated, we'd be in a very different world.
So, get vaccinated. If you haven't, you're not nearly as smart as I said you were.
Thanks. (Applause.)
